# API Gateway

Designed and built a scalable API gateway using Laravel to handle authentication, rate limiting, and routing for a suite
of microservices. The gateway serves as a single entry point for all API requests, providing a unified interface for
clients.

## Key Features

- JWT-based authentication and authorization
- Intelligent request routing to appropriate microservices
- Rate limiting and throttling protection
- Request validation and transformation
- Detailed logging and monitoring
- Cache management with Redis

## Implementation Details

The API Gateway was built with Laravel and deployed on AWS using Docker. It utilizes Redis for caching and rate
limiting, ensuring high performance even under heavy load.

The architecture follows best practices for microservices, with clear separation of concerns and a focus on scalability.

## Results

The gateway handles over 1 million daily requests with an average response time of less than 100ms. It has significantly
simplified the client integration process and improved overall system reliability.
