# Inventory Management System

Developed a real-time inventory management system for a wholesale distributor with multiple warehouses. The system
provides accurate inventory tracking, automated reordering, and analytics.

## Key Features

- Real-time inventory updates with WebSockets
- Barcode scanning integration for warehouse operations
- Automated purchase order generation based on inventory levels
- Detailed reporting and analytics dashboard
- Multi-warehouse support with inventory transfer workflows
- Mobile-responsive interface for warehouse staff

## Technical Implementation

The system uses a PHP backend with a Vue.js frontend, connected through RESTful APIs and WebSockets for real-time
updates. MySQL handles the data storage with carefully designed schemas to ensure data integrity and performance.

The entire application is containerized with Docker for consistent deployment across environments.

## Results

The inventory management system reduced inventory discrepancies by 85% and improved warehouse efficiency by 40%. The
automated reordering functionality has eliminated stockouts and reduced overstock situations, resulting in significant
cost savings.
