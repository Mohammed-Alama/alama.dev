# Spryker E-commerce Platform

During my time at Spryker, I worked on developing and maintaining custom modules for various e-commerce platforms. This
involved creating scalable solutions for inventory management, order processing, and customer relationships.

## Key Contributions

- Developed custom modules for specific client requirements
- Optimized database performance resulting in 30% faster load times
- Implemented automated testing procedures, increasing code reliability
- Collaborated with a team of 8 developers across different time zones

## Technologies Used

The project utilized Spryker's microservice architecture along with:

- PHP 8.0
- MySQL for data storage
- Docker for containerization
- RabbitMQ for message queuing
- Redis for caching
- AWS for infrastructure

## Results

The improvements led to a more stable platform with faster performance and lower maintenance costs for the client. The
modular approach allowed for easier updates and feature additions in the future.
