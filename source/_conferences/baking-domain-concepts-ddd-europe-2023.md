## Key Takeaways

### Domain-Driven Design in Practice

Paul Rayner demonstrates practical approaches to embedding domain knowledge directly into code:

- Making domain concepts explicit in the codebase
- Ensuring code reflects the ubiquitous language
- Creating a clear mapping between business terminology and implementation

### Code Organization Techniques

Various techniques to better organize code around domain concepts:

- Strategic use of value objects to represent domain concepts
- Designing aggregates that enforce invariants
- Establishing clear boundaries between different contexts
- Using naming conventions that reflect domain terminology

## How I'll Apply This

I plan to review our current codebase with these principles in mind, looking for opportunities to better express domain concepts through code. This should lead to more maintainable and understandable applications that better align with business needs.
