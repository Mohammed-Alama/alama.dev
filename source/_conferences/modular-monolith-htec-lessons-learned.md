## Key Takeaways

### Real-World Experience

Honest assessment after two years of modular monolith implementation:

- Initial assumptions vs. reality of daily development
- Unexpected challenges that emerged over time
- Success stories and areas where the architecture excelled
- Performance and scalability lessons learned

### Common Mistakes

Key mistakes made during implementation:

- Module boundary decisions that proved problematic
- Over-engineering vs. under-engineering module interfaces
- Database design decisions that created coupling
- Team organization and ownership issues

### Lessons Learned

Valuable insights from the journey:

- Importance of clear module contracts and interfaces
- Evolution strategies for module boundaries
- Testing approaches that actually work in practice
- Deployment and monitoring considerations

### What Could Have Been Better

Retrospective improvements and recommendations:

- Different architectural decisions that would have been more effective
- Tooling and processes that could have prevented issues
- Team practices and communication strategies
- Migration strategies for problematic modules

## How I'll Apply This

This retrospective provides invaluable real-world insights for modular monolith implementation. I'll use these lessons to avoid common pitfalls, make better architectural decisions upfront, and plan for the evolution and maintenance challenges that inevitably arise in long-term projects.
