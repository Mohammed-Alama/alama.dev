## Key Takeaways

### Modular Monolith Fundamentals

Understanding the core concepts of modular monoliths:

- Combining the simplicity of monoliths with the modularity of microservices
- Clear module boundaries with well-defined interfaces
- Shared database vs. separate schemas per module
- Communication patterns between modules

### Design Principles

Key principles for successful modular monolith design:

- High cohesion within modules, low coupling between modules
- Clear ownership and responsibility boundaries
- Explicit contracts and interfaces between modules
- Avoiding shared mutable state across module boundaries

### Implementation Strategies

Practical approaches to building modular monoliths:

- Package organization and module structure
- Dependency management and circular dependency prevention
- Testing strategies for individual modules
- Deployment and versioning considerations

### When to Choose Modular Monoliths

Decision criteria for architectural choices:

- Team size and organizational structure considerations
- Complexity and performance requirements
- Operational capabilities and infrastructure constraints
- Migration paths from traditional monoliths or to microservices

## How I'll Apply This

This knowledge will help me design better monolithic applications that maintain clear boundaries and can evolve over time. I'll use these principles to create systems that provide the benefits of modular design while avoiding the complexity of distributed systems when they're not necessary.
