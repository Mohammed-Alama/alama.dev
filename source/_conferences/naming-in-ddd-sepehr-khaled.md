## Key Takeaways

### The Power of Names

Understanding how naming impacts software design:

- Names are the primary way we communicate domain concepts in code
- Poor naming leads to misunderstandings and wrong implementations
- Good names make code self-documenting and easier to maintain
- Names should reflect the business language, not technical implementation details

### Building Ubiquitous Language

Strategies for developing shared vocabulary:

- Collaborative discovery sessions between developers and domain experts
- Iterative refinement of terms and concepts
- Documentation and glossaries of domain terminology
- Consistent usage across code, documentation, and conversations

### Naming Patterns and Techniques

Practical approaches to better naming:

- Using domain-specific terminology instead of generic terms
- Avoiding technical jargon in business logic
- Making implicit concepts explicit through naming
- Evolving names as understanding of the domain deepens

### Common Naming Pitfalls

Mistakes to avoid in DDD naming:

- Using database or infrastructure terms in domain models
- Generic names that don't convey domain meaning
- Inconsistent terminology across the codebase
- Names that reveal implementation details rather than business intent

## How I'll Apply This

This knowledge will improve how I communicate with stakeholders and structure domain models. I'll focus on developing clear, business-focused naming conventions that make the codebase more accessible to both technical and non-technical team members, creating better alignment between code and business requirements.
