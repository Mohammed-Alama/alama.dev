## Key Takeaways

### Evolution of Understanding

Greg Young's reflections on how understanding of these patterns has evolved:

- Initial misconceptions and oversimplifications of DDD concepts
- How CQRS and Event Sourcing are often misunderstood and misapplied
- The importance of understanding when NOT to use these patterns
- Real-world complexities that emerge in production systems

### CQRS Lessons Learned

Practical insights about Command Query Responsibility Segregation:

- CQRS is not about databases - it's about models
- Eventual consistency challenges and solutions
- When to use simple CQRS vs. full event sourcing
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

### Event Sourcing Reality

Real-world event sourcing implementation insights:

- Storage and performance considerations at scale
- Handling schema evolution and event versioning
- Snapshotting strategies and when they're necessary
- The complexity of replaying events and maintaining projections

## How I'll Apply This

This retrospective provides valuable insights for making informed architectural decisions. I'll use Greg's lessons to avoid common pitfalls when considering CQRS or Event Sourcing, ensuring these patterns are applied only when they provide clear benefits and understanding their real-world complexities.
