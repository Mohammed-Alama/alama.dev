## Key Takeaways

### Composition API Benefits

Evan demonstrated several key performance benefits of the Composition API over the Options API:

- Better tree-shaking support
- More efficient reactivity system
- Improved memory usage patterns
- Easier code organization for complex components

### Compiler Improvements

Vue 3's compiler has several optimizations that make runtime performance better:

- Static hoisting of unchanging elements
- Patch flags for more efficient updates
- Block tree optimization for reduced memory allocation
- Better static content handling

### Practical Tips

Several practical tips that I can immediately apply to my projects:

1. Use `v-once` for truly static content
2. Apply `v-memo` for conditional re-rendering optimizations
3. Implement virtualization for long lists
4. Use `shallowRef` and `shallowReactive` when deep reactivity isn't needed
5. Lazy load components for better initial page load

## How I'll Apply This

I plan to refactor our dashboard component using these techniques. Currently, it renders hundreds of items and can feel
sluggish. By applying virtualization and the proper use of `v-memo`, I should be able to significantly improve the
performance.

Additionally, I'll review our largest components and see if we can benefit from moving more of them to the Composition
API, particularly those with complex state management needs.
