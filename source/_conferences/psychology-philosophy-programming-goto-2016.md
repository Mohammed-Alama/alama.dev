## Key Takeaways

### Interdisciplinary Connections

Ted Neward explores the fascinating connections between:

- How psychological principles affect our approach to software development
- Philosophical concepts that underpin programming paradigms
- The human aspects of coding that aren't taught in computer science courses

### Mental Models in Programming

The talk examines how our mental models shape our code:

- How different programming paradigms reflect different philosophical worldviews
- The psychology behind code readability and maintenance
- Why team dynamics and communication patterns impact code structure

### Practical Implications

Several practical insights that can improve day-to-day programming:

- Techniques to overcome cognitive biases in software development
- Ways to improve code organization based on how humans process information
- Approaches for better technical communication and knowledge sharing

## How I'll Apply This

This talk has given me a broader perspective on software development beyond just technical concerns. I plan to be more mindful of the human factors involved in programming, both in how I structure my own code and how I collaborate with other developers.
