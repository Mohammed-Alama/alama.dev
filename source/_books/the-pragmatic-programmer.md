## Initial Thoughts

I'm halfway through this book and already finding it incredibly valuable. The authors present practical advice in a
clear, no-nonsense manner that's immediately applicable to my daily work.

## Key Concepts (So Far)

- **DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Every piece of knowledge should have a single, unambiguous representation
  within a system.

- **Orthogonality**: Components should be independent, with changes in one not affecting others. This makes systems more
  maintainable and testable.

- **Tracer Bullets**: Implement a small end-to-end feature first to provide a framework for development and gather early
  feedback.

- **Programming by Coincidence**: Don't code by chance or assume things work without understanding why. Be deliberate
  and intentional in your programming.

## What I'm Learning

I particularly appreciate the emphasis on taking responsibility for your code and career. The sections on automation and
avoiding repetitive tasks have already influenced how I organize my workflow.

The idea of "good enough" software—balancing quality with practicality—has been helpful in preventing perfectionism from
slowing down my projects.

I'm looking forward to finishing the rest of the book and applying more of these pragmatic principles in my work.
