## Why I Read This Book

I wanted to improve the quality of my code beyond just making it work. As I've progressed in my career, I've realized
that writing code that others (including my future self) can easily understand and maintain is just as important as
writing code that functions correctly.

## Key Takeaways

### Meaningful Names

One of the simplest yet most impactful lessons was about choosing descriptive names for variables, functions, and
classes. Uncle Bob emphasizes that code should read like well-written prose, and good naming is essential for that.

### Functions Should Do One Thing

The principle that functions should do "one thing" and do it well has transformed how I structure my code. I've found
that following this rule leads to more modular, testable, and maintainable code.

### Comments Are a Last Resort

Rather than relying on comments to explain confusing code, the book taught me to make the code itself clearer. Comments
should be used sparingly and only when the code cannot be made self-explanatory.

## How I've Applied It

I've implemented a personal checklist based on the book's principles that I run through before submitting code for
review. This has significantly reduced the number of issues found during reviews and has made my code more consistent.

The chapter on unit testing has especially influenced my work, leading me to adopt test-driven development practices
more consistently.

In retrospect, this book has been one of the most influential in my development as a software engineer, and I continue
to reference it regularly.
