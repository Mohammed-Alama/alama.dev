## Initial Thoughts

I'm finding this book particularly useful as I'm working on modularizing larger codebases and creating reusable
packages. The author does an excellent job of explaining abstract design principles with concrete PHP examples.

## Key Concepts (So Far)

### SOLID Principles in Package Design

The book takes the SOLID principles beyond class design and shows how they apply at the package level:

- **Single Responsibility**: Packages should focus on one specific domain concept
- **Open/Closed**: Package interfaces should be stable while implementations can evolve
- **Liskov Substitution**: Components should honor the contracts they implement
- **Interface Segregation**: Package APIs should be focused and minimal
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

### Package Cohesion Principles

I've found the section on package cohesion particularly enlightening:

- **Release Reuse Equivalency**: Only group things that can be released together
- **Common Reuse**: Group classes that tend to be used together
- **Common Closure**: Group classes that change together

## What I'm Learning

The practical guidance on structuring namespaces, designing package interfaces, and managing dependencies between
packages has already influenced how I approach my current projects. I'm excited to finish the book and apply these
principles to create more maintainable and reusable code.
