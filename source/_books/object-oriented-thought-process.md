## Why I Read This Book

After working with object-oriented programming for years, I wanted to revisit the fundamental concepts and ensure I
wasn't missing anything important in my design approach. This book is well-regarded for its accessible exploration of
OOP concepts regardless of programming language.

## Key Takeaways

### Thinking in Objects

The book helped me shift from procedural thinking to truly understanding objects as self-contained units with both
attributes and behaviors. This mental model creates more maintainable and reusable code.

### Encapsulation and Information Hiding

The distinction between these two concepts was particularly valuable. While encapsulation is about bundling data and
methods, information hiding is about protecting internal implementation details. Both are crucial for creating robust
systems.

### Proper Inheritance Usage

I appreciated the clear explanation of when to use inheritance versus composition, and how to avoid common pitfalls like
fragile base classes and inappropriate inheritance hierarchies.

### Design Principles Beyond Basics

The book goes beyond basic OOP concepts to introduce important design principles like:

- Separating interface from implementation
- Programming to interfaces, not implementations
- Creating cohesive classes with high internal consistency
- Keeping coupling between components low

## How I've Applied It

I've revisited several of my projects with these principles in mind and found opportunities to improve my designs. I've
been more careful about inheritance relationships, more consistent about encapsulation, and more thoughtful about class
responsibilities.

The lessons from this book have been especially helpful when working on larger teams, as they provide a common
vocabulary and set of principles for discussing code organization and design decisions.
