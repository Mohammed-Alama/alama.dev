## Why I Want to Read This

I'm looking to strengthen my understanding of database fundamentals and explore different database technologies beyond
the ones I commonly use in my projects. This book appears to provide a comprehensive yet concise overview of both
relational and NoSQL database systems.

## What I Hope to Learn

- A deeper understanding of database design principles and normalization
- Insights into different database paradigms and their appropriate use cases
- Performance optimization techniques for database queries
- Better practices for working with both SQL and NoSQL databases
- How to make more informed decisions about database architecture

This knowledge should help me design more efficient database structures and make better technology choices for future
projects, especially as data requirements grow more complex.
