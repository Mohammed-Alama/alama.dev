## Why I Want to Read This

Though it was published in 1994, this book remains one of the most influential works in software engineering. I'm
interested in understanding these classic patterns that have shaped modern programming practices and frameworks.

## What I Hope to Learn

I want to develop a stronger vocabulary for describing software solutions. By understanding these established patterns,
I expect to:

1. Recognize common patterns in the codebases I work with
2. Communicate more effectively with other developers about design choices
3. Avoid reinventing solutions to problems that have already been solved elegantly
4. Make better architectural decisions in my own projects

Despite its age, I've heard that the principles in this book are still relevant to modern software development. I'm
curious to see how these patterns have evolved and how they apply to today's programming paradigms.

I've added this classic book to my reading list after repeatedly encountering references to the Gang of Four design
patterns in codebases and technical discussions.

Several senior developers have recommended this book as essential reading for advancing my understanding of software
architecture and object-oriented design principles.

I'm particularly interested in learning more about:

- Creational patterns like Factory Method and Singleton
- Structural patterns like Adapter and Decorator
- Behavioral patterns like Observer and Strategy

I plan to start reading this after finishing The Pragmatic Programmer, and I'll update my notes with insights as I
progress through the material.
